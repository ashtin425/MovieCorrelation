# MovieCorrelation
In this project I took a csv file containing data from movies and used a heatmap to show correlation between the several columns of data. My first thought was gross and budget would have a high correlation so I created a simple scatter plot to get an idea if there was a positive or negative trend in the data. After that I used reglot from seaborn in order to create another scatter plot, but this time also having a line the gives a clear indication of a positive or negative correlation. Next I used the .corr() function on the dataframe to see the correlation of all columns the have numerical values and created a heatmap using this data. Lastly I created a for loop to turn all object type columns to category, then cat.codes to give each columns distinct description an individual number and ran another heatmap with all columns now available for testing correlation.
